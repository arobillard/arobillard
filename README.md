# Hi there! 👋

I've been working as a web developer 💻, designer 🖌️, and educator 🎓 for over 6 years. I have experience working in every step of the web process including project management, user research, content structure/planning, design, development, deployment, and maintenance. I am passionate about the entire web process and my broad background allows me to bring knowledge to every stage and to provide the perspective needed to ensure all areas of a project work seamlessly together.

When not working or teaching, I usually can be found developing web projects just for myself as I believe that the best way to learn and improve is to experiment with new ideas and technologies. If you are interested in seeing my work, feel free to take a look at my repositories or checkout my portfolio website: [adamrobillard.ca](https://adamrobillard.ca)
